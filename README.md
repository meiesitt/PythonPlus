# Python+
Python+ is an amazing library to put into your project for beginners. It contains multiple functions like `wait()` or `clear()`.
Why do extra work if you can let Python+ do the heavylifting? Download the latest release and simply add the Python file to your project directory. Import it and enjoy!

## ðŸŽ¯ Our aim
Python+ contains multiple useful functions, with newer additions being added frequently. Our aim is to help keep your code clean while also ensuring reliability. With good error handling, we can guarantee that you will not run into problems with our library.
Additionally, Python+ is completely open-source, meaning you can happily view the source of `api.py` and discover how Python+ works.
We like to keep our code open so we can guarantee the safety of our library.

## ðŸ“ƒ Prerequisites
As for the possible version of Python needed, each release has the version of Python used noted in the description of each release.
The way Python works is slightly changed almost every version of Python, so to ensure your projects don't suddenly stop working when using Python+, we will try our best to use the newest versions of Python.

## ðŸ”’ Safe Code
I, as of writing this as the sole developer of Python+, will promise to you to use the best of my abilities when updating Python+. I will never include possibly malicious code, which can be checked by anyone. I apologize if the code is not readable, I rarely remember to include comments while working on code.
